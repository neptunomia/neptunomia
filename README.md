# Hi 👀, I’m Noémie!

Rigorous, creative and passionate, I'm an independent front-end developer 👩‍💻 established in France 🇫🇷. 

I’m really interested about creative development 🎨 and learning new stuffs 📚. In addition to my job, I draw and paint 👩‍🎨.

I mainly work with **Next.js, React.js and Sass**. Besides, I continue to develop my skills with **Node.js, Express.js and MongoDB**. 

I am interested in collaborating on open-source projects for front-end needs.
